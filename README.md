# Web Development Project 1 - *Internship Community Board*

This web app: **A community board that holds a total of 16 internship links for CS students to use so they can easily 
access applications without having to go look for them. CS students usually very busy so making it quick and fast
to access these links would be helpful.**

## Notes

Struggled a bit with the syntax for the images because it is a little different in React
than actual HTML, but the rest I had an idea on what to do. Used the table tag in order to
essentially create index cards that included the name of the company, its locations, and
the link to their application site. The cards where a component that I made. All this came 
together to create the community board.
